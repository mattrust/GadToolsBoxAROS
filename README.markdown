GadToolsBox v3 is a powerful GUI generator for AmigaOS. It uses
gadtools.library and some other external gadgets. With GTB v3 You can
highly expand your GUI with a lot of features like toolbars, tree
listviews, page gadgets, clipboards. GTB v3 is something like resource
editor, You can create here almost everything using all of OS features.
You can draw pictures, mouse pointers, edit locale strings, create menus,
windows, toolbars, version strings and much more, everything with one
program.

Generated source code is similiar to very well known source code
generated by old GadToolsBox by Jaba Development. So, turning to new GTB
is very easy, but programs need to be reworked (there are a new functions
and there is other naming convention). Of course GTB v3 can load old
resources from GadToolsBox v2 (all #?.gui files), but you cannot load GTB
v1 resources.
